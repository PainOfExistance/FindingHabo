In this tome, the lore and chronicles of Habo's artifacts shall be unveiled. Behold, the Habo items, five, mayhaps six, treasures imbued with arcane might, forged by the hands of Habo himself, wielded to triumph in the Battle of Iladas. Fashioned within the fabled Forge of Fate, nestled amidst the craggy peaks of Alam in the western realm of Kiavar, these artifacts now lie scattered across the land, dispersed by Habo's decree upon his vanishing.

1. "IS", the shield and blade, a chariot clad in steel, adorned with an ever-flowing barrier encasing its iron wheels. Its form resembles a sarcophagus, offering sanctuary to those within, with a rotating pan capable of dealing swift justice upon foes. This artifact grants unparalleled defense and offense, rendering its bearer impervious to the mightiest of assaults and bestowing upon them the prowess to strike down adversaries with lethal precision.

2. "Steel bird", the swiftness incarnate, fashioned in the likeness of a metallic avian, with triangular tail feathers intersected by a vertical spine. Its wings, akin to sturdy tubes, bear shovel-like appendages, while its beak, a black semi-circle resembling glass, hints at its swift flight. This artifact endows its possessor with lightning speed, enabling them to evade myriad enemy strikes with ease.

3. "Blue", the harbinger of strength, a compact amalgamation of cuboid and cylindrical forms, adorned in azure hues, with six small wheels,short stumpy boiler reminiscent of a miniature caravan and short stumpy funnel. This artifact grants its wielder unparalleled power to transport goods across vast distances, akin to a whole troupe of traders and their laden steeds.

4. "A book", the repository of wisdom, its crimson and orange visage akin to a tome of bound knowledge, connected by azure bands reminiscent of scholarly tomes. This artifact bestows upon its reader the secrets of the universe, granting access to sacred knowledge and unparalleled enlightenment.

5. "Red star", the beacon of camaraderie, a crimson-hued celestial body containing tools of agriculture and industry, arranged in a golden constellation at a 45-degree angle. This artifact grants its bearer the ability to rally allies to their cause, persuading the masses to aid them in their endeavors.

These five artifacts, crafted by Habo's skilled hands, hold sway over the realm of Kiavar. Yet whispers abound of a sixth item, shrouded in legend and mystery. Some claim it to be the key to unlocking the true potential of the others, a metaphysical state of being accessible only to those of pure heart. Whether it be the embodiment of true love or a beacon of hope, its existence remains a matter of speculation. It is said that only through a catalyst can this state be awakened, ushering forth a power capable of bending the very fabric of reality to the will of its possessor.

Such is the saga of the Habo items, scattered across the lands of Kiavar, their tales woven into the tapestry of history.
